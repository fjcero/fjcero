### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Product-minded and multiple hats wearer programmer, focused on delivering value in every part of the product lifecycle, always taking data-driven decisions with more than 14 years of experience as a Software Engineer for a wide range of industries in Startups, Large Companies, and fully Remote contexts.

I craft software with a combination of high-quality standards and elegant user-experiences.

The passion for entrepreneurship, teamwork, leadership, and my experience growing startup cultures and building products, led me to the journey of working on challenging problems alongside fast-paced teams that prioritize data-based decisions to create things people want.
